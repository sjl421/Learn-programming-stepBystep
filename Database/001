Data && Information

---数据的格式化
Keep in mind that raw data must be properly formatted for storage, processing, and presentation.
For example, in Panel C of Figure 1.1, the student classification is formatted to show the results based 
on the classifications Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, and Graduate Student. The respondents’ yes/no 
responses might need to be converted to a Y/N format for data storage. More complex formatting is required 
when working with complex data types, such as sounds, videos, or images.

In this “information age,” production of accurate, relevant, and timely information is the key to good decision making.
In turn, good decision making is the key to business survival in a global market.

Knowledge implies familiarity, awareness, and understanding of
information as it applies to an environment. A key characteristic of knowledge is that “new” knowledge can be derived
from “old” knowledge.
