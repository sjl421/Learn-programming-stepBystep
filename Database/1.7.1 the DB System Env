# 1.7.1 the DB system environment

数据库系统指的是一系列组件，这些组件规定了在这个数据库环境中 数据的聚合，存储，管理和使用。
从管理角度看，数据库系统包含以下五大部分：hardware, software, people, procedures, and data.

1 Hardware. Hardware refers to all of the system’s physical devices; for example, computers (PCs, workstations,
servers, and supercomputers), storage devices, printers, network devices (hubs, switches, routers, fiber optics),
and other devices (automated teller machines, ID readers, and so on).

2 Software. Although the most readily identified software is the DBMS itself, to make the database system
function fully, three types of software are needed: operating system software, DBMS software, and application
programs and utilities.

- Operating system software manages all hardware components and makes it possible for all other software
to run on the computers. Examples of operating system software include Microsoft Windows, Linux, Mac
OS, UNIX, and MVS.
- DBMS software manages the database within the database system. Some examples of DBMS software
include Microsoft’s SQL Server, Oracle Corporation’s Oracle, Sun’s MySQL, and IBM’s DB2.
- Application programs and utility software are used to access and manipulate data in the DBMS and to
manage the computer environment in which data access and manipulation take place. Application
programs are most commonly used to access data found within the database to generate reports,
tabulations, and other information to facilitate decision making. Utilities are the software tools used to help
manage the database system’s computer components. For example, all of the major DBMS vendors now
provide graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to help create database structures, control database access, and
monitor database operations.
